Interpretation of the error messages:
a) The program doesn't know the type string and variables cout, cin, endl, 
which are all predifined variables from the iostream library and the
namespace std.
b) In critter.h file setHunger (the method I deleted the prefix 
Critter:: from) is a method (a function that is part of the Critter class), 
but in critter.cpp it is defined as simply an independent function.

Potential alternative solutions:
a) The issue can be solved by using the scope resolution. 
To be particular, by adding the prefix std:: to every function/method
from the iostream library. This includes: string, cout, cin, endl in 
testcritter.cpp and critter.cpp.
b) It can be solved by adding the method definition instead of the method
declaration in the header file or by returning back the Critter:: prefix.
